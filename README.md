# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLO-
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, designed for high-speed and accurate identification of multiple objects from live video feeds. The system can process webcam input or video streams, making it suitable for surveillance, reconnaissance, and defense-related applications.
